Description: JASPAR (https://jaspar.elixir.no/) is an open-access database that
             has provided high-quality, manually curated, and non-redundant DNA
             binding profiles for transcription factors (TFs) as position 
             frequency matrices (PFMs) for over 20 years. For this 11th release
             of the database, we expanded our CORE and UNVALIDATED collections 
             with new PFMs and updated existing profiles. Specifically, we 
             added 306 and 433 new binding profiles to the CORE (a 12% 
             increase) and UNVALIDATED (a 60% increase) collections, 
             respectively, and updated 13 profiles from the CORE collection.
             With the new collections of PFMs, we updated the TF binding site 
             predictions in eight species and provided the corresponding 
             genomic tracks. Moreover, we updated the profile clusters and 
             familial TF binding sites accordingly. This release introduces a 
             regulatory sequence simulation tool, inMOTIFin, enabling users to 
             simulate regulatory sequences using JASPAR PFMs. To enrich the 
             annotations linked to the TFs, JASPAR now provides scientific 
             literature-based human TF target information derived from a large 
             language model. Notably, this release features the addition of a 
             new collection of deep learning BPnet models, providing a paradigm
             shift in modeling and characterizing TF-DNA interactions, driven 
             by advances in artificial intelligence. JASPAR 2026 provides 1304 
             BPNet models trained on Homo sapiens ENCODE ChIP-seq datasets from
             264 TFs. Interpretation of the BPnet revealed critical binding 
             profiles that were curated and matched to JASPAR CORE PFMs for an 
             easy overview of the binding patterns. Profiles from BPnet models 
             associated with the same TF were clustered to provide a 
             non-redundant summary of the binding properties of the TF, 
             resulting in 266 primary motifs in the new Deep Learning 
             collection. The 2026 release of JASPAR now offers the classical 
             manually curated collections of TF binding profiles and 
             state-of-the-art deep learning models. These collections lay a 
             foundation for future endeavors in genomic research, serving the
             scientific community in uncovering the mechanisms of gene 
             regulation.
